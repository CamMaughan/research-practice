# research-practice
This is a collection of code I have collated while learning python. Files are marked for personal practice code and research code. This can be code that I have found interesting and wish to analyze and replicate. Or code that I have found interesting but that I do not understand yet.

Files include comments of my analysis, learning and insights from the given file. These comments will be found at the top of the files, labelled 'Reflection'.
