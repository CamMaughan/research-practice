# research-practice
This is a collection of code I have collated while learning python. Files are marked for learning code, research of others code that explains design principals, and finally practice code that takes what I learnt from analysing others code.

Within the files code are comments of my analysis, learning and insights from the given file. 

In the research folder - from others code I have copied into this repository. All the comments in these files are my own, showing my analysis of the code.

In the research intergrated practice folder I made two projects: A library management system and a to do list, both named accordingly. I used these as practice for following programming principles and espescially for learning object orientated programming in python. They took me some time to work out and some imported modules took research to learn how to use. I strengthened my knowledge of the SOLID principles. Though also inheritance, encapsulation, and property decorators which are quite interesting to use. 

I found the start of my python learning journey engrossing and I'm eager to learn more.
